        <b>a.Cool the burn.</b>
        <br>  Hold the burned area under cool (not cold) running water
            or apply a cool, wet compress until the pain eases.
            Donot use ice.Putting ice directly on a burn can
            cause further damage to the tissue.</br>
        <b>b.Apply lotion.</b>
        <br>Once a burn is completely cooled, apply a lotion,
            such as one that contains aloe vera or a moisturizer.
            This helps prevent drying and provides relief.</br>
        <b>c.Bandage the burn.</b>
        <br>Cover the burn with a sterile gauze bandage (not
            fluffy cotton).Wrap it loosely to avoid putting pressure on
            burned skin.Bandaging keeps air off the area, reduces
            pain and protects blistered skin.</br>
        <b>d.Take a pain reliever. </b>
        <br>Over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen
            (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve)
            or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), can help relieve pain.</br>

        <b>First aid</b>
        <br><b>A.</b>Keep the person still do not move them unless there is
            an immediate danger, especially if you suspect fracture
            of the skull, spine, ribs, pelvis or upper leg.</br>
        <br><b>B.</b>Attend to any bleeding wounds first. Stop the bleeding
            by pressing firmly on the site with a clean dressing.
            If a bone is protruding, apply pressure around the edges
            of the wound.</br>
        <br><b>C.</b>For a limb fracture, provide support and comfort such
            as a pillow under the lower leg or forearm. However,
            do not cause further pain or unnecessary movement of
            the broken bone.</br>
        <br><b>D.</b>Apply a splint to support the limb. Splints do not
            have to be professionally manufactured. Items like
            wooden boards and folded magazines can work for some
            fractures. You should immobilise the limb above and
            below the fracture.</br>
        <br><b>E.</b>Stop the person from eating or drinking anything
            until they are seen by a health care professional in
            case they need surgery.</br>

            the wound with their hand or hands to stem the
            blood flow.If the person can’t do it, apply direct 
            pressure yourself.</br>
